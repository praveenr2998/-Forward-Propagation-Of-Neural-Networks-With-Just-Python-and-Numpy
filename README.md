# Forward-Propagating-Neural-Network-With-Just-Python-and-Numpy
A neural network (just forward propagation) written completely using python and numpy

The code is written withou using tensorflow/pytorch. It is just using python and numpy.

The desired layers (input/output/hidden) could be given and a suitable neural network with randomized weights and biases will be made ready.
